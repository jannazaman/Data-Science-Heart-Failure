# Data-Science-Heart-Failure
Goals for the Analysis of the Dataset:
Our main goal is to accurately predict the target variable given the predictors of age, sex, exercise angina, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved of the patient and so forth. Our target variable will include a binary value that represents 0 as having a lower chance of having a heart attack and 1 as having a higher chance of having a heart attack. Essentially, 1 equates to heart disease and 0 is normal. We believe it is important to be able to accurately predict whether someone is prone to having a heart attack, as it can allow patients to adjust their lifestyle (earlier on) accordingly for heart attack prevention, and potentially not result in heart failure. 

Research Question:
Could we accurately predict an individualâ€™s chance of getting a heart disease (heart failure) based on the predictor variables in the Heart Failure dataset? If so, which model amongst KNN or SVM provides a more accurate result?
